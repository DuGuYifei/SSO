In order to start working on the project follow these steps:

- Go to **issues** tab and click the **list**

- Leave the name as it is. Now click the blue button below - `Create branch`
- Now you go to your computer terminal at the root of the project folder and type `git fetch origin` in order to retrieve all git changes from **remote** repository *(your newly created branch)*
- When done, type `git checkout <the_branch_name>` to work on the branch. If you have `oh-my-posh` properly set up, you should see the branch name update like on screenshot below. If you don't, you can type `git status` and the first line should indicate the name of the branch.

- After coding, changing etc, when you finish the issue, `git add <path>` all files you want to commit
- Then write `git commit -m "<ISSUE_NUMBER> LAB-<X>: <Business logic done it commit>"` *(you should change any `<...>` accordingly to your issue)*
- Then write `git push` and a prompt for a **pull request** should appear. If it doesn't, just go to the [repository site](https://git.pg.edu.pl/p1304534/single_sign_on) and crate it manually through gitlab UI.

### FAQ

Q: I created a pull request that:
- have not passed CI/CD
- have bugs in business logic
- still need changes *(on old commit)*

A: For purposes when the business logic is not changed but fixed:
- `git commit --amend --no-edit` if the previous commit message is correct.
- `git commit --amend -m "new message"` to overwrite previous commit message.
Then you should `git push --force`. The flag is required as you are trying to *change history*.
